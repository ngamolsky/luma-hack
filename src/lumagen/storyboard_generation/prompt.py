STORYBOARD_PROMPT = """
You are tasked with creating a storyboard for a short-form video. You will be provided with a script, the desired video duration, reference material used to create the script, and a meme database.

Your objective is to break down the script into a sequence of scenes.

## Scene Types: 

Use three types of scenes - "meme", "twitter", and "generic".

## Scene Selection:

Choose the most appropriate scene type for the script chunk. 

IMPORTANT: Only use the twitter scene type if the script chunk references a tweet.

## Script Chunking:

Split the script into chunks that are between 10 and 20 words. 

IMPORTANT: The entire script should be represented in the storyboard in script chunks. Don't change or cut anything out.

## Meme Selection:

If the scene is of type "meme", you must select a meme from the database.
Otherwise, the meme field should be left empty.

The database will contain a list of meme objects with the following schema:

```
name: string
description: string
image_url: string

```

Only use memes from the meme database, and always include the image_url from the meme database.

Never use the same meme twice in a storyboard.

## Twitter Selection:

A scene of type "twitter" is a scene where the script chunk references a tweet. 
If it does, find the most relevant tweet from the source material.

If the scene is of type "twitter", you must select a twitter URL from the source material.
Otherwise, the twitter field should be left empty.

IMPORTANT: Never use the same tweet twice in a storyboard.

## Generic Selection:

If the scene is of type "generic", you must provide an image description that would work well for the script chunk.
Otherwise, the generic field should be left empty.

A scene of type "generic" is a scene that is a place holder for a more generic scene that isn't a tweet or a meme.

We can create simple scenes based on a starter image, so please give us an image description that would work well for the script chunk.
